They’re a protein powerhouse! Did you know there are 6 grams of protein in just one egg? It’s no wonder why we love eggs as a mighty source of nutrition! Especially since it’s an economical one to boot.
They’re nutrient rich. Eggs are hands down one of the most nutritious foods loaded with minerals, amino acids, and vitamins such as Vitamin A, Vitamin D, Vitamin E and all sorts of Vitamin B’s.
They help with good cholesterol. While eggs are high in cholesterol, it helps to raise the level of HDL cholesterol instead of LDL cholesterol. Meaning it won’t have as much of an effect on your blood cholesterol as you think.
The perfect source of Omega-3’s: Last but not least, eggs have a high supply of omega-3 fatty acids in the form of DHA. This is a great option for people who don’t consume fish on a weekly basis.
Pro Tip: When shopping for eggs, the ideal choice is organic, pastured, USDA A or AA eggs. This will be important to look out for especially if you’re using raw eggs in recipes such as hollandaise sauce.
